Online Reputation Management (ORM) is the strategic process of monitoring, 
influencing, and controlling the perception of a brand, organization, or individual 
on the internet. It encompasses a range of activities, including tracking online 
mentions, responding to customer feedback, managing reviews, and shaping public 
perception through proactive communication. In the digital era, where consumers 
increasingly rely on online information to make purchasing decisions, ORM has 
become a critical aspect of brand management. The goal of ORM is not only to 
mitigate negative publicity but also to enhance a brand’s credibility, foster trust, and 
maintain a positive relationship with its audience across various online platforms, 
such as social media, review websites, blogs, forums, and e-commerce portals. 
In digital marketing, ORM holds immense importance. With the exponential 
growth of social media and user-generated content, a single negative review or viral 
incident can significantly impact a brand’s reputation and sales. Conversely, a 
strong and positive online presence can attract more customers, boost engagement, 
and establish a brand as a trusted and authoritative figure in its industry. ORM, 
therefore, is not just a defensive measure—it is an essential part of a proactive 
digital marketing strategy aimed at sustaining long-term growth and customer 
loyalty. 
For this report, Nike, the globally renowned sportswear and lifestyle brand, has 
been selected for analysis. Nike is a leader in athletic footwear, apparel, and 
equipment, with a significant digital footprint spanning e-commerce platforms, 
social media channels, and online communities worldwide. The choice of Nike is 
particularly relevant because the brand operates in a highly competitive and trend
driven market where consumer perceptions and experiences are constantly shared 
online. Nike’s reputation is influenced not only by its product quality and 
innovation but also by its marketing campaigns, corporate social responsibility 
initiatives, and interactions with consumers on digital platforms. 
Nike’s ORM practices are noteworthy because the brand actively monitors and 
manages its online image, responds to customer feedback, and addresses 
controversies strategically. Additionally, its digital campaigns, influencer 
collaborations, and social media engagement demonstrate how effective ORM can 
enhance brand loyalty, attract new customers, and maintain a positive global image. 
By studying Nike’s ORM strategies, this report aims to provide insights into how a 
major global brand navigates the challenges and opportunities of maintaining a 
strong online reputation in the modern digital landscape.
